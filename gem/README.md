# Mumuki Emojis

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/mumuki/emojis`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'mumuki-emojis'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install mumuki-emojis

## Development

1. `nvm use`
1. `npm install`
1. `npm run build`
1. `cd gem`
1. `./bin/setup`
1. `bundle install`


To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
